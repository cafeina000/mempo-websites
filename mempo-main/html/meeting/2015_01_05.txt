=== PLAN of the meeting ====

Please, read this before joining :)

Hi guys! This is our progress, and what help we loop for (HELP), including trivial work or testers marked as (T).
See this document and connectd links, and prepare any questions and we will gladly reply to them on the meeting;
Or just tell us what you need/want. Or offer to help even just test stuff.

--- rfree, mempo, vyrly ---

DONE: (T) we now offer hardened kernel, with pax flags(A), in apt-get repository accessible from internet and darknet Freenet(E) and i2p(E) and Tor, we also support Freenet board system FMS(M).

DONE: We have http://deb.mempo.org webiste, also via .i2p and via Freenet (addresses are on the page)
DONE: (T) apt-get works over freenet :) this is first time ever. Details are on the page. Apt-get is configured by i.sh install script.

DONE: simple pax_flags.sh script configured programs like firefox, java to disable some of strong Pax protections that kill programs using JIT.
TODO: the pax_flags.sh should be packed in a .deb, with dpkg triggers (man 1 deb-triggers) to observe /usr/[s]bin , /[s]bin, to reapply flags on binary programs upgrade

TODO: a freenet-dumb-installer.sh that makes user srv_fn, downloads freenet installer .jar, checksums/GPG checks, runs it (yeap I know this is not the best way)
TODO: a freenet-dumb-installer.deb (yes I know this is not the best way) that does the above later
HELP: maybe someone wants to develop a real serious .deb installer for Freenet? Some work was started on this.

TODO: a .deb with FMS (freenet message system)

TODO: publish in repository the .deb of libpoco that fixes utf8 bug. The solution is not fully the Debian-Way but works: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=671477 just need to publish it. Our solution is reproducible build script: https://github.com/mempo/mempo-deb/tree/master/pack/poco but is uses odd script and does not have a deb-src
HELP: Someone could make a real debian package for the libpoco fix in form of deb orig tar gz + debian patch so we can generate deb + deb-src.
HELP: Someone could make a real fix for libpoco not just a work around; AFAIR the patch is not a preferred solution for Debian because it duplicates library symbols?
HELP: (T) someone with freenet: could keep-alive our repository and also run the script that keeps downloading our files as posted on FMS.
HELP: (T) someone with a server: could run an automatic mirror spider of deb.mempo.org to his server, and tell us to list him as backup.

TODO: make the kernels have a package with same name so that aptitude upgrade does upgrade it, instead of manual search for newest kernel. We have a solution in form of virtual package e.g. linux-image-3.2-mempo-servmax that will depend on the newest kernel release like mempo 0.1.97.
TODO: above solution has downside of not deleting old versions like 0.1.96, it should have some conflict or recommend remove field? Just markign it for auto-removal might not be enough as linux-image* packages AFAIK are by default retained and not cleared from apt local cache, using disk space in /var/. We must remove the package installation to clear disk space in /lib/modules/ and /boot/ (and for security - old kernels)

HELP: provide a .deb with TBB, verify it's build (I hope it is determinitic) so we can push that to our repo
HELP: provide a script to run kvm image with Tails one-time OS - looking for developer. Probably make a .deb with run-tails script, and deb with the iso image.
